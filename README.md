# Pok√©mon TCG Pocket Scraper

## Overview

Welcome to the **Pok√©mon TCG Pocket Scraper** project! üéâ

This project was born out of my enthusiasm for Pok√©mon TCG Pocket during its early days. At the time, the game had limited in-game activities, so I decided to create a comprehensive database of card information for analysis, collection tracking, and other fun uses.

In addition to serving my passion for Pok√©mon, this project was also a great opportunity to experiment with web scraping and enhance my coding skills. I'm making it public in case it proves helpful to others who share the same interests. ü§ì

## Features

### What Does This Project Do?

The scraper navigates to:
- [Serebii.net](https://www.serebii.net) (Special thanks to Joe for maintaining this amazing resource over the years. If this project causes any issues, please let me know, and I‚Äôll take it down! üôè)
- [Limitless](https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards)

It scrapes Pok√©mon TCG Pocket card information, including:
- Name
- Stage and previous forms
- Set and pack details
- Rarity and appearance rates
- Stats like type, HP, and retreat cost
- Attack details, including damage and energy cost
- Weaknesses and abilities

The scraped data is saved as JSON files for easy use in analysis, application development, or collection tracking.
