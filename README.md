# Pok√©mon TCG Pocket Scraper

## Overview

This project is a personal endeavor I started because of my enthusiasm for Pok√©mon TCG Pocket during its early days. At that time, the game had limited in-game activities, and I wanted to explore more by creating a database of card information for analysis and other fun uses.

I also took this opportunity to experiment with web scraping and enhance my coding skills. Since the project might be helpful to others, I'm making it public for anyone interested! ü§ì

## What Does This Project Do?

The scraper visits the [Serebii.net](https://serebii.net) website (shout-out to Joe for the incredible effort over the years! If this causes any issues, I'm more than happy to take it down). It navigates to the Pok√©mon TCG Pocket section and iterates through all available items, scraping details about each card and formatting the information into JSON.

You can find the latest JSON output under `cards.json`. If you only need the card data, feel free to grab that directly.

**Note:** I've intentionally excluded duplicate cards like alternate versions of _Pikachu ex_, as they contain the same core information and are effectively identical.

## Example Card Information

```json
{
    "Name": "Pikachu ex",

        "FourthSlot": "0.333%",
        "FifthSlot": "1.332%",
        "Rarity": "4 Diamonds"
    },
    "Number": 96,
    "Details": {

        "Attacks": [
            {

                    "Electric",
                    "Electric"
                ],
                "MaxDamage": 90,
                "IsVariableDamage": true,
                "AdditionalText": "This attack does 30 damage for each of your Benched Electric Pok√©mon"
            }
        ],
        "Weakness": "fighting",
        "RetreatCost": 1,
        "Abilities": []
    }
}
```

## Why Make This Public?

This project started as a way for me to explore web scraping and learn more about Pok√©mon TCG data, but I figured others might find it useful or interesting. Whether you're a fellow Pok√©mon fan or just curious about scraping and data analysis, I hope you can benefit from this work.

Feel free to use, adapt, or build upon it! If you have any feedback, I'd love to hear from you.
